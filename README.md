# TrulyPresent
Many institutes and schools still rely on pen-paper based attendance in this digital era. This takes a lot of lecture time and effort by the lecturers often leading to errors and chaos. Through this project, we aim to empower institutions and educators with a fully automated android app for attendance using the power of Deep Learning. The Backend has been facilitated using FireBase and FireStore. The Welcome page consists of Login and SignUp facility for the users. Further, when an authenticated user signs in,  they are taken to the admin dashboard where they can view their details and the subjects they teach and to which batch. On selecting the subject for which the lecture was just conducted, they are re-directed to click/upload a picture of the classroom after the lecture, would be displayed with the list of students present in the class. We have used AlexNet Architecture for facial recognition of an individual person's face. For extraction of multiple images of the students, we have used haarcascade classifier which would segment the faces from the class picture and then send them to the model for facial recognition, one by one. This project aims to revolutionize the attendance process making it much more convenient and at the tips of users.
