# TrulyPresent
Even in this digital era, it has been seen that many institutes and schools still rely on pen-paper based attendance which takes a lot of lecture time and effort by the lecturers often leading to errors and chaos. Through this project, we aim to empower institutions and educators with a fully automated attendance android app using the power of Deep Learning. The Backend has been facilitated using FireBase. The Welcome page consists of Login and SignUp of the users. Further, when an authenticated user signs in, they can view their respectively taught subjects. On selecting the subject for which the lecture was just conducted, they are re-directed to click/upload a picture of the classroom after the lecture, and they would be displayed with the list of students present in the class. We have used AlexNet Architecture for facial recognition of an individual person's face. For extraction of multiple images of the students, we have used haarcascade classifier which would segment the faces from the class picture and then send them to the model for facial recognition, one by one. This will completely digitalize the attendance process.
